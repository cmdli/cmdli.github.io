                <h1>Questions on Consciousness</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">July 8 2023</p>
                <p>
                    Consciousness is one of the greatest extant mysteries to our
                    current understanding of the universe, and it is somewhat of
                    a strangely overlooked question. Every creature that is
                    reading this is (presumably) conscious, and (presumably) has
                    an intuitive understanding of what consciousness is. We know
                    that we are currently conscious, and we presume that when we
                    are deeply asleep, under anesthesia, or otherwise
                    incapacitated that we are not conscious. However, a lot of
                    our assumptions about consciousness are not as strong as
                    they may first appear after looking more closely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us take the assumption of unconsciousness. There are
                    many common situations during which we assume we are
                    unconscious, the most common of which is sleeping. However,
                    how can we truly know that we are unconscious? The basis for
                    this assumption relies mostly on the fact that it appears to
                    us that we go to sleep and then immediately wake up, with no
                    conscious activity inbetween. Unfortunately, this relies on
                    the implicit assumption that consciousness requires memory,
                    which it does not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we are asleep, there are times that we are certainly
                    dreaming in an altered state of consciousness, and if we are
                    woken up we can describe and remember those dreams. However,
                    if we are not woken up, we do not remember those dreams, and
                    to us in the morning it is as if we were not conscious at
                    all. A similar situation happens when people enter into
                    altered states of consciousness such as getting severely
                    intoxicated, where a person can be up and moving about,
                    talking and taking action, but have no memory of those
                    actions after the event. Even when under anesthesia,
                    patients can be somewhat active and answer questions, but
                    have no memory of those events afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What does this mean? These situations demonstrate that a
                    lack of memory does not necessarily indicate a lack of
                    consciousness. We can experience phenomena and be conscious
                    even if we do not remember it afterward. This has serious
                    implications for a lot of our beliefs about consciousness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us take an extreme example and consider the situations
                    where our physical body no longer exists. Most assume that
                    we were not conscious before we were conceived and born
                    (more believe this than consciousness after death). However,
                    what do we base this belief on? We assume it to be true
                    because no person who has been born has any memory from
                    before the event, but as previously shown this does not
                    indicate a lack of consciousness. In fact, every person
                    reading this has no memory of shortly after they are born,
                    even more than a year after the event, but nobody disputes
                    that newborn infants are conscious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some might attempt to use physical phenomena as a way to
                    determine if we are conscious. We might assume that
                    consciousness requires certain patterns of molecules to
                    interact in a certain way, and if those molecules are not
                    interacting then consciousness does not happen. For example,
                    if the cells in our brain do not conform to (presumably)
                    normal patterns of activity, then we are not conscious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trouble with this sort of belief is that it is not
                    powerful enough to disprove unusual situations. Let us take
                    the example of a person with a severely altered brain state
                    because of a traumatic injury. This person’s brain is active
                    and neurons are firing, but the person themselves is not
                    awake and communicating with the outside world. Unlike
                    “locked-in syndrome”, where a person is definitely conscious
                    but unable to physically move any part of their body, this
                    injured person's brain is only partially active, or perhaps
                    active in a different way, and this activity does not
                    correlate with the brain activity of other people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Would such a person be conscious? Would we consider them to
                    be in pain? Perhaps they experience some sort of happiness
                    or contentment currently, much more so then a regular person
                    would. How can we tell? How could we decide if we should let
                    the person die or allow them to live? The theory of
                    consciousness that correlates it with the common type we
                    experience every day is not powerful enough to answer these
                    questions, but these questions do have answers. The person
                    themselves knows whether they are conscious, and if we could
                    just find a way to communicate with them they could tell us.
                    This is an area where our current understanding of science
                    is insufficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My hope, and the reason I am writing this, is that one day
                    we will have a better way of answering these questions. I
                    hope that we will move away from the assumption that
                    consciousness and neurotypical humanity are one and the
                    same, and we might eventually find a better basis for
                    answering these questions. I have no idea what such a basis
                    might be, but if we believe that science can answer all our
                    questions then the answers must be out there, somewhere.
