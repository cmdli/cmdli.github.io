                <h1>The Misalignment between Founders and Investors</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">December 11 2022</p>
                <p>
                    There is a fundamental misalignment in incentives between
                    founders and VCs or accelerators like YCombinator. This
                    incentive difference is hard to see, as it requires us to
                    realize some unusual things about how we view and value
                    money. The simple (and mostly correct approach) is this:
                    investors and founders have a similar incentive because they
                    both get paid the same way, through stock. If the stock goes
                    up, that benefits both the investor and the founder, and if
                    the stock goes down, it hurts the investor and the founder.
                    However, that ignores a key factor in incentives: risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explain this, let's take a potential startup idea. This
                    startup idea has a 1% chance of succeeding, and if it
                    succeeds then it becomes a $1 billion company. In this
                    situation, the founder and the investor succeed and fail in
                    the same way, but they massively differ in the risk they are
                    taking on. The founder is working on one company, and so has
                    a 99% chance of failing and going bankrupt. The investor is
                    likely investing in many different companies, each with a
                    different 1% chance of failure, and so has a much less than
                    99% chance of going bankrupt. This means that the investor
                    is fundamentally much more willing to take that 1% chance at
                    a $1 billion company. The investor would never take a deal
                    that has a 99% chance of causing bankruptcy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A founder is primarily motivated by the chance to become
                    rich. They don't care that much between making $50 million
                    or $500 million on their company, because both mean that
                    they wouldn't have to work for the rest of their life. The
                    extra money isn't actually useful of incentivizing to them.
                    The only founders that care about building those $1 billion
                    companies are either people who want the power that comes
                    with money or the prestige that comes from “being the best”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make this point clearer, lets consider an alternate idea:
                    a startup idea with a 10% chance of creating a $50 million
                    company. The founder would very much prefer this idea, as
                    they have 10x the chance of being rich, but the investor
                    hates this idea because it has a lower expected return. The
                    founder just wants to be rich, whether that is $10 million
                    or $100 million, but 10 vs 100 can be the difference between
                    life or death for the investor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Investors want to chase the highest returns possible; the
                    billion dollar unicorns that have almost no chance of
                    manifesting. Founders, on the other hand, just want any
                    successful company, even if it becomes a midrange company in
                    the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This difference in risk is part of the reason why investors
                    act as they do and why founders act as they do. Investors
                    like VCs and accelerators will tell founders that they want
                    them to be contrarian, or to go for the “big ideas”, or to
                    take massive risks, because those have the highest expected
                    returns. However, founders are not truly incentivized to do
                    those things because the extra returns don't really matter
                    to them. In the end, founders are incentivized to lie about
                    their company and play up how big it is going to be to
                    investors, and try to hide this misalignment from them.
