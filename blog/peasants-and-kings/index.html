                <h1>Peasants and Kings</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">November 20 2022</p>

                <p>
                    Imagine a medieval kingdom, perhaps one that was around in
                    1000AD. Around 90% of the people in that kingdom were
                    peasants and worked the land. In order to grow food, they
                    had to till the soil and plant the seeds, care for the
                    crops, and then spend large amounts of time and energy
                    harvesting it. For all of that work, the peasants got food
                    for the year and were maybe able to afford a few extras,
                    after taxes of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now also in this kingdom was a king and a bunch of nobles
                    and princes. Such noblemen didn't have to work and were able
                    to afford the greatest luxuries available a the time: meat
                    every day, comfortable clothes, entertainment, books, etc.
                    These people did not earn their position, they did not work
                    harder than the peasants, and the kingdom is most likely not
                    improved by what the noblemen do most of the time, which is
                    enjoying themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, this situation is incredibly unfair. The peasants
                    do almost all of the work and have very little, while the
                    noblemen do almost no work and live lives of luxury. In
                    addition, the noblemen oftentimes make the peasants lives
                    even worse by going to war with one another or by extorting
                    the populace with taxes or by allowing bandits to run free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the peasants, one day, decide to upturn the system. And
                    they do! They get rid of the noblemen and stop paying taxes
                    to them. Through some miracle, no noblemen rise to take
                    their place, and the peasants are free of their torment and
                    oppression. And what do the peasants do the next day?
                </p>
                <p>
                    They go back to work. They spend most of their time tilling
                    the soil, planting seeds, caring for crops, and so on. The
                    peasants have to work because there is no other way to get
                    enough food for them all to eat. Somebody has to do that
                    work to grow the crops, and so each peasant is still
                    required to live a life full of manual labor, not much
                    different than before. They may have stopped the taxes and
                    injustice, but they still need to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's more, their lives are no closer to the lives of
                    relative luxury we live today. In modern times, most of us
                    are not required to work the fields, and very few of us are
                    needed to make enough food to survive. The peasants have not
                    made any progress towards lives like ours, because they
                    haven't fixed the fact that causes their misery: everybody
                    has to work in order to eat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, let's shift focus to today. In modern times, we have
                    modern peasants and modern kings. Modern peasants, otherwise
                    known as normal people, work for a living. Each person
                    works, perhaps from 9am to 5pm or slightly longer, in order
                    to get the money in order to survive. We need to pay for
                    food, we need to pay rent, we need to pay for health
                    insurance, everything costs money. Our lives are much better
                    than the peasants of before, but every one of us still needs
                    to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have modern day kings, otherwise known as
                    billionaires. They live lives of luxury and are able to
                    afford everything they could ever want. They do not work for
                    their money and do not contribute. They profit off of the
                    labor of the rest of us and use that money to enjoy
                    themselves. What's more, they also use their power and
                    influence to enforce the status quo, raise prices, and
                    giving themselves tax benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system is also incredibly unfair. Take Jeff Bezos as an
                    example, who has reportedly around 177 billion dollars,
                    which, to put it mildly, is an obscene amount of money. Jeff
                    Bezos could spend and spend and spend and spend and wouldn't
                    come even close to running out. There is no conceivable
                    world where Jeff Bezos *needs* this much money, and its
                    highly debatable that he deserves it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, let's take a closer look. Let's say through some
                    miracle we manage to take away all of Jeff Bezos' money.
                    Ignoring the fact that most of it is not cash, or that it
                    would be very hard to convert and split up, or that Mr Jeff
                    Bezos would likely make it very, very hard to find all of
                    it, let's say we could simply do it. If we took all that
                    money and split it up amongst every man, woman, and child in
                    the US, everybody would get around $536. Don't
                    misunderstand, that isn't nothing, and perhaps people's
                    lives would be slightly better off with that money, but it
                    isn't life changing. It's not going to fix most people's
                    problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Now wait,” you might say, “That's only Jeff Bezos. What if
                    we took away all the billionaires wealth?”. According to the
                    Forbes 400, the richest 400 Americans, which has a cutoff of
                    around $2.1 billion, have a combined wealth of around $4,500
                    billion. Ignoring the fact that a lot of that money came
                    from outside the US, if we split up that money among all the
                    330 million Americans then everybody would get $13,636.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that is a number worth considering. That amount of money
                    could certainly help people a lot, and perhaps it is worth
                    the effort to go out and get it from all the billionaires.
                    However, I would like to pose a serious question: if you got
                    that amount of money, once in your life, would the course of
                    your life be considerably different? Recently, many
                    Americans got a single $10,000 student loan forgiveness. Was
                    that enough? Would the money cover the enormous costs of
                    healthcare, student loans, rent, and inflation all combined?
                    Would that $13,636 be enough to permanently fix your life,
                    or would you still have to go back into work tomorrow?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be clear, these questions aren't meant to discourage
                    taxing the rich. I genuinely think its a good idea, and the
                    rich can certainly afford it. But it's important to put into
                    perspective that the problems we face as a society aren't
                    going to be solved by just taxing billionaires. Taxing
                    billionaires isn't going to be enough to pay for all the
                    healthcare and education and housing that we want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we need, more than taxing billionaires, is to fix the
                    root causes of these problems. We need to build more
                    housing, fix cost/profit overruns in healthcare, and bring
                    the cost of college down. We need to invent new technology
                    and regulate monopolies and improve our public education
                    system. We need to truly examine why our system is broken
                    and try to fix the system, not spend 10 years trying to get
                    rid of the billionaires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are difficult problems, problems I don't have the
                    answer to. These problems don't make for great talking
                    points or funny memes or passionate discussion. Perhaps
                    working within the system is needed, perhaps tearing down
                    the system and building a new one is needed. I'm not sure.
                    What I am sure of is that the solution to our problems will
                    be found in building better systems rather than chasing
                    scapegoats.
